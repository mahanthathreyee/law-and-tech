# Mozilla v FCC

## Petitioner's Brief

> Are the Petitioners for or against net neutrality?

Petitioners are **FOR** net neutrality.

> What are the main arguments/support for the Petitioners position?

- The FCC wrongly reclassified BIAS from a "telecommunications service" to an "information service," against statutory definitions
- The FCC justified reclassifying BIAS by arguing that since BIAS allows users to access third-party information services, BIAS itself is an information service. 
	- This rationale fails to distinguish between the service's role in providing access to the internet (a telecommunications function) and the nature of the content and services accessed, which are the actual "information services."
- The FCC improperly used functions like DNS and caching to label BIAS as an information service, ignoring their ancillary nature.
- The FCC's repeal of open internet rules neglects its duty to protect public interest and maintain an open internet.
	- This decision undermines the foundational principle of net neutrality, which ensures that BIAS providers do not block, throttle, or unfairly prioritize internet traffic.

## FCC's Brief

> Is FCC for or against net neutrality (in relation to this reading)?

FCC is **AGAINST** net neutrality.

> What are the main arguments/support for the FCC's position?

- The FCC decided to treat broadband as a lighter-regulated "information service," believing this encourages more innovation and investment than the previous, stricter "telecommunications service" classification.
- The FCC ruled that mobile internet is not a "commercial mobile service" needing strict regulation, aiming for consistent treatment with fixed broadband to not over-regulate.
- With broadband reclassified, the FCC removed strict rules, opting for a simpler approach that relies on companies being transparent and existing laws to prevent abuse, which is seen as more efficient.
- The FCC believes that less strict regulation will lead to more broadband investment and doesn't see the need for old rules because competition and legal protections against abuse already exist.
- The FCC decided to override any state or local laws that are stricter than its own, to ensure the internet is governed uniformly across the U.S., preventing a mix of different rules in different places.

# Autonomous Weapons System

> How are autonomous weapons similar and different compared to:
> 1. conventional weapons
> 2. human combatants
> 3. child soldiers
> 4. animal combatants

| **Aspect**             | **Conventional Weapons**                                                                                                          | **Human Combatants**                                                                                                                                         | **Child Soldiers**                                                                                                                | **Animal Combatants**                                                                                                                                 |

| **Similarity**         | AWS are like conventional weapons in that they can be lawful under specific conditions (e.g., not causing unnecessary suffering). | AWS and human combatants share the capability for independent action on the battlefield.                                                                     | AWS, child soldiers, and animal combatants are capable of autonomous action and may act unpredictably.                            | Similar to child soldiers, AWS and animal combatants can act autonomously and unpredictably.                                                          |
| **Difference**         | AWS's capacity for independent and unpredictable action complicates their legal review and accountability.                        | Unlike humans, AWS cannot be traditionally trained or held accountable for their actions.                                                                    | The legal and societal motivations for regulating child soldiers (to protect children) do not apply to AWS.                       | The rationale for regulating animal combatants does not directly apply to AWS, and there's almost no existing law specifically for animal combatants. |
| **Accountability Gap** | N/A                                                                                                                               | AWS actions that result in violations of international humanitarian law highlight an accountability gap not addressed by the law governing human combatants. | Similar accountability issues as with human combatants; existing frameworks do not accommodate autonomous systems' liability.     | Similar to child soldiers, the unique challenges of AWS accountability are not resolved within the current legal frameworks.                          |
| **Regulation Needs**   | Existing weapons law does not fully address AWS's unique challenges, such as in-field learning and ensuring discriminate use.     | Current combatant law fails to provide guidelines on "training" AWS or addressing the accountability gap for their autonomous actions.                       | Child soldier regulations highlight the need for tailored AWS laws that consider their non-human nature and operational autonomy. | The lack of specific law for animal combatants underscores the necessity for new regulations specifically designed for AWS.                           |

# Trolley and Pinto Problem

> What was the Pinto Problem? 

This problem is exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Ford Pinto in the 1970s, where Ford Motor Company faced criticism for its decision-making process regarding the safety of the vehicle's fuel tank design. Despite being aware of the hazards related to the design, Ford adhered to the original design based on a cost-benefit analysis that compared the costs of making safety improvements against the benefits of preventing fuel tank fires. This analysis calculated the monetary value of human lives and injuries in a way that suggested a willingness to accept human casualties in favor of cost savings.

> How is the Pinto problem similar/different to the Boeing 737 MAX case?

- **Technical and Contextual Nature of Failures:**
    - The Pinto problem was related to a specific design flaw (fuel tank design) that made the car susceptible to catching fire in rear-end collisions.
    - The 737 MAX issue involved a complex flight control system (MCAS) designed to enhance the aircraft's performance, which malfunctioned due to sensor errors and lack of adequate pilot training and information.

- **Regulatory and Industry Environment:**
    - The automotive industry regulations and standards at the time of the Pinto were less comprehensive in addressing safety issues compared to the highly regulated aviation sector during the 737 MAX's development.
    - The Boeing 737 MAX case also involved criticisms of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for its certification process and alleged closeness with Boeing, which was not a significant aspect of the Pinto case.

- **Complexity of Technology and Information Disclosure:**
    - The Boeing 737 MAX's problems were partially attributed to the complexity of modern aviation systems and Boeing's failure to disclose critical information about the MCAS system to pilots and airlines.
    - The Pinto's design issue, by contrast, was a more straightforward safety risk that did not involve the complexities of software or system-wide integration failures.

- **Global Impact and Scale:**
    - The Boeing 737 MAX incidents had a global impact, grounding the worldwide fleet and affecting international air travel, whereas the Pinto issue primarily affected consumers in the United States.
    - The scale of the 737 MAX crisis involved multiple international investigations and a broader scrutiny of global aviation safety practices, while the Pinto controversy was more contained within the automotive industry and national regulatory responses.

# Free Speech in an Algorithmic Society

> Why is Professor Balkin worried about freedom of speech in the current era?

Professor Balkin is concerned about freedom of speech due to the pervasive influence of Big Data and new forms of speech regulation. 

He sees Big Data as a power structure where personal information becomes a commodity, likened to "Soylent Green," leading to surveillance, control, discrimination, and manipulation by both governments and private companies. 

Additionally, the evolution from traditional to new forms of speech regulation, exemplified by the right to be forgotten and the spread of fake news, challenges traditional free speech protections, raising issues around censorship, privacy, and misinformation in the digital age.

> Who does Professor Balkin believe must play a role in preserving freedom of speech?

The best solution would be for large international infrastructure owners and social media platforms to change their self-conception. 

Ideally, they would come to understand themselves as a new kind of media company, with obligations to protect the global public good of a free Internet, and to preserve and extend the emerging global system of freedom of expression. 

Defenders of democratic values should work hard to emphasize the social responsibilities of digital infrastructure companies and help them both to understand and to accept their constitutive role in the emerging global public sphere.

> What are information fiduciaries? What is their role?

Information fiduciaries are entities that have a duty to protect the personal information of individuals they interact with, similar to the fiduciary responsibilities of doctors or lawyers to their clients. 

They must act in the best interests of those whose data they hold, ensuring confidentiality and preventing misuse. This concept suggests that companies collecting and handling significant amounts of personal data should be regulated to enforce ethical standards of trust, confidentiality, and care towards individuals' data.

> Why can't digital information fiduciaries should have fewer obligations than traditional professional fiduciaries according to the author?

1. Their business significantly involves monetizing personal data, unlike traditional fiduciaries.
2. Digital platforms encourage public expression and content creation, affecting how user data is handled and expected to be protected.
3. The level of trust and care expected from digital platforms by users is different; users do not expect digital platforms to protect their interests to the same extent as traditional fiduciaries like doctors or lawyers.

> What is trolling and doxing?

**Trolling:** Refers to the act of deliberately posting provocative or offensive content online to elicit a strong emotional response or disrupt conversations.

**Doxing:** Researching and publicly sharing private or identifying information about an individual without their consent, often to harass, intimidate, or shame them.

> How does Professor Balkin want potentially harmful online phenomena, like trolling and doxing, to be addressed, and by whom?

TBD

> What is an "algorithmic nuisance" and how should this phenomenon be addressed?

**Algorithmic nuisance:** Refers to the negative impact of companies using big data and algorithms to make judgments that affect people's identities, traits, associations, opportunities, and vulnerabilities. It captures the idea of companies externalizing the socially unjustified costs of their decision-making onto individuals. 

To address this phenomenon, it's suggested that there should be regulations aimed at the outputs of algorithmic decision-making, such as discrimination and manipulation, ensuring companies internalize the costs they impose on society and individuals through their practices.
