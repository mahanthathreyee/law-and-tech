## Mozilla v FCC

### Petitioner's Brief

> Are the Petitioners for or against net neutrality?

Petitioners are **FOR** net neutrality.

> What are the main arguments/support for the Petitioners position?

- The FCC wrongly reclassified BIAS from a "telecommunications service" to an "information service," against statutory definitions
- The FCC justified reclassifying BIAS by arguing that since BIAS allows users to access third-party information services, BIAS itself is an information service. 
	- This rationale fails to distinguish between the service's role in providing access to the internet (a telecommunications function) and the nature of the content and services accessed, which are the actual "information services."
- The FCC improperly used functions like DNS and caching to label BIAS as an information service, ignoring their ancillary nature.
- The FCC's repeal of open internet rules neglects its duty to protect public interest and maintain an open internet.
	- This decision undermines the foundational principle of net neutrality, which ensures that BIAS providers do not block, throttle, or unfairly prioritize internet traffic.

## FCC's Brief

> Is FCC for or against net neutrality (in relation to this reading)?

FCC is **AGAINST** net neutrality.

> What are the main arguments/support for the FCC's position?

- The FCC decided to treat broadband as a lighter-regulated "information service," believing this encourages more innovation and investment than the previous, stricter "telecommunications service" classification.
- The FCC ruled that mobile internet is not a "commercial mobile service" needing strict regulation, aiming for consistent treatment with fixed broadband to not over-regulate.
- With broadband reclassified, the FCC removed strict rules, opting for a simpler approach that relies on companies being transparent and existing laws to prevent abuse, which is seen as more efficient.
- The FCC believes that less strict regulation will lead to more broadband investment and doesn't see the need for old rules because competition and legal protections against abuse already exist.
- The FCC decided to override any state or local laws that are stricter than its own, to ensure the internet is governed uniformly across the U.S., preventing a mix of different rules in different places.

# Autonomous Weapons System

> How are autonomous weapons similar and different compared to:
> 1. conventional weapons
> 2. human combatants
> 3. child soldiers
> 4. animal combatants

| **Aspect**             | **Conventional Weapons**                                                                                                          | **Human Combatants**                                                                                                                                         | **Child Soldiers**                                                                                                                | **Animal Combatants**                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Similarity**         | AWS are like conventional weapons in that they can be lawful under specific conditions (e.g., not causing unnecessary suffering). | AWS and human combatants share the capability for independent action on the battlefield.                                                                     | AWS, child soldiers, and animal combatants are capable of autonomous action and may act unpredictably.                            | Similar to child soldiers, AWS and animal combatants can act autonomously and unpredictably.                                                          |
| **Difference**         | AWS's capacity for independent and unpredictable action complicates their legal review and accountability.                        | Unlike humans, AWS cannot be traditionally trained or held accountable for their actions.                                                                    | The legal and societal motivations for regulating child soldiers (to protect children) do not apply to AWS.                       | The rationale for regulating animal combatants does not directly apply to AWS, and there's almost no existing law specifically for animal combatants. |
| **Accountability Gap** | N/A                                                                                                                               | AWS actions that result in violations of international humanitarian law highlight an accountability gap not addressed by the law governing human combatants. | Similar accountability issues as with human combatants; existing frameworks do not accommodate autonomous systems' liability.     | Similar to child soldiers, the unique challenges of AWS accountability are not resolved within the current legal frameworks.                          |
| **Regulation Needs**   | Existing weapons law does not fully address AWS's unique challenges, such as in-field learning and ensuring discriminate use.     | Current combatant law fails to provide guidelines on "training" AWS or addressing the accountability gap for their autonomous actions.                       | Child soldier regulations highlight the need for tailored AWS laws that consider their non-human nature and operational autonomy. | The lack of specific law for animal combatants underscores the necessity for new regulations specifically designed for AWS.                           |
